# dom-delegation-stream

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/thebigspoon/dom-delegation-stream.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/thebigspoon/dom-delegation-stream)

simple streaming DOM event delegation

## example

```javascript
var events = require('dom-delegation-stream')
  , values = require('dom-value-stream')

events(document.body, 'input', 'input[type=text]')
  .pipe(values())
  .pipe(wherever())
```

## api

#### events(element, eventName[, selector, options]) -> ReadableStream

* if selector is provided, delegation will be used, otherwise it will not.
* valid options are:
  - `preventDefault <boolean>`: will call `preventDefault()` on all matched
  events. Defaults to `false`.
  - `stopPropagation <boolean>`: will call `stopPropagation()` on all matched
  events. Defaults to `false`.
  - `useCapture <boolean>`: will initiate capture for matched events. Defaults
  to `false`.

## notes

* there are some alternative options for event handling on npm, a couple that
  even support delegation, and even some that are streaming. this module was
  created as an effort to provide a better balance of simplicity and
  flexibility.
